If you write lots of HTML documents such as user-guides then it's really helpful to have a bunch of styles at your fingertips to highlight, use space, turn lists into obvious sequences of do this, then that, then the other.  Box-outs are easy and useful for warnings or tips.  A 'download' link should be a button with a clear cursor.  Tables can easily be organised with coloured columns, headings and totals.

Additional css files provide flowchart and application control buttons.

The showcase and cheatsheet is at http://vulpeculox.net/misc/style/CheatSheet.htm
You can download a single file with images inlined from http://vulpeculox.net/misc/style/index.htm and get started immediately.

The sources are available zipped here or from vulpeculox.net

You may not like my 'look and feel' but you have the classes set out for the structural elements you might use so just hack the css colours or widths or heights as much as you like.
